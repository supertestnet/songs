La Bitcoin Song by Super Testnet

```
You better buy you la bitcoin
You better buy you la bitcoin
It help you out, you be happy with bitcoin
It's a musical hit-coin, and if you smart
It's a good for your wit-coin
If you hitting the gym, bitcoin is in
It go with you, it's fit-coin

Now don’t be buying no altcoin
If you do it's your fault-coin
But don’t despair, you can always just halt-coin
Dump it all for...
Only bitcoin
Only bitcoin
Only bitcoin

Now we got lightning, it's blitz-coin
And if you like-a the glam, bitcoin's a ham
Gettin' rich with the glitz-coin
If you're at a hotel, bitcoin is swell
It's the Carlton Ritz-coin

[Music break]

You better buy you la bitcoin
It's a good choice for us all, like if you're tough,
Bitcoin too, it's got grit-coin
If you're making a shirt, bitcoin can't hurt
Take a needle and knit-coin
If you like to write code, keep bitcoin stowed
For the hackers it's git-coin

Only bitcoin
Only bitcoin
Only bitcoin
La bitcoin!
La bitcoin!
```
