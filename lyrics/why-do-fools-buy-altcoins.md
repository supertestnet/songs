Why do Fools Buy Altcoins by Super Testnet

```
Oh wah, oh wah
Oh wah, oh wah
Oh wah, oh wah
Why do fools buy altcoins?

Why do these scam coins all sell?
And why do folks think they’ll do well?
Why do they buy altcoins?

Why do they think bitcoin’s on the brink?
What could be in their drink?
Why do they buy altcoins?

Some say bitcoin is too slow
Their coin’s run by corporates though
Some say there’s no privacy
Then tell me who is Satoshi?

Tell me why, why, why
Tell me why

[music break]

Why do folks think altcoins will rise?
When bitcoin outlives their demise?
Why do they buy altcoins?

Why do they throw all their cash away?
Why do fools trade all day?
Why do they buy altcoins?

Why do they roll the dice without success?
Bitcoin will grow til they all acquiesce

Tell me why, why, why
Tell me why
Why do fools buy altcoins?
```
