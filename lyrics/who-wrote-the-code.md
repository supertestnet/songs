Who Wrote the Code by Super Testnet

```
I'd like to meet the gal
Who wrote the code
That made my coins
Secure for me

Who put the hash in the hashlock contract
Who put the share in shamir secret share scheme
Who put the swap in the submarine swap
Who put the bip in the bip review process
Who was that gal
I'd like to be her pal
She made me sure my coins belong to me (yeah)

When I heard her words
"Key derivation, cryptographic hash"
Every word went right into my heart
And when I heard her teaching
"Graphing the edges of peer to peer topologies"
I knew my node was sure to start (so)

Who put the hash in the hashlock contract
Who put the share in shamir secret share scheme
Who put the swap in the submarine swap
Who put the bip in the bip review process
Who was that gal
I'd like to be her pal
She made me sure my coins belong to me (yeah)

When I send my coins
"Child pays for parent, bump replace by fee"
Sets me so at ease, ‘cause I know
That every time a block’s mined
"Difficulty target, merkle tree inclusion proof"
I go aquiver head to toe (so)

Who put the hash in the hashlock contract
Who put the share in shamir secret share scheme
Who put the swap in the submarine swap
Who put the bip in the bip review process
Who was that gal
I'd like to be her pal
She made me sure my coins belong to me (yeah)

Darling, blockheight discrete log contracts in zero knowledge
And my honey, tapleaf tagged hashes forever
And when I say, sha256, ripemd160, ecdsa
You know I mean it from the bottom of my blinded multisignature oracle

Who put the hash in the hashlock contract
Who put the share in shamir secret share scheme
Who put the swap in the submarine swap
Who put the bip in the bip review process (yeah)
