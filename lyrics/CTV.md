When your blockchain doesn't work at scale
And on lightning your payments start to fail
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Well, check out my solution
A small fork called – CTV

Hear my reasons, I'll try to motivate
We'll see fee spikes til we activate
Uh, don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like a cry?
Come on, CTV!

Whoa, nothing could be sweeter than a payment pool, you see
In the group, fees are moot, and all transactions free
Yeah, and as more people join, the pool becomes a sea
So come on, run a node and signal for CTV

If you're waiting for devs to get on board
And you never get your voices heard
Won't you feel like crying?
Won't you feel like crying?
Well, you can keep on cry-cry-crying til – CTV
Whoa, cry-cry-cry-cry-crying til – CTV
