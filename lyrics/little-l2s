Little L2s by Super Testnet

```
I used to take my bitcoins
And send them to L2s
So when I saw the Lightning Network
I did what I do

Little L2, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh-huh
(Uh-huh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

I bought myself some channels
But a force close shut them down
And now my money’s stuck until
A couple weeks go ‘round

Little L2, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh-huh
(Uh-huh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

So next I tried an ecash mint
My coins went fast and cheap
But then that mint he robbed me
So now I sit and weep

Little L2, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh-huh
(Uh-huh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

I put some coins on Liquid
And it seemed to work at first
But since it has no users
All my excitement burst

Little L2, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh-huh
(Uh-huh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

Well, I played with bitcoin’s layer twos
But none could satisfy
I hope we get some drivechains
Cause I’d give them try

Little L2, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh-huh
(Uh-huh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

(Uh-huh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)
(Uh-huh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)
